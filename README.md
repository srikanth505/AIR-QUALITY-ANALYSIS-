# Overview

Welcome to the Air Quality Analysis Project in Tamil Nadu repository. This project is focused on the analysis and visualization of air quality data collected from monitoring stations in Tamil Nadu, India. The primary objectives are to gain insights into air pollution trends, identify areas with high pollution levels, and develop a predictive model to estimate RSPM/PM10 levels based on SO2 and NO2 levels.

# Project Objectives

1. **Analyze Air Quality Trends**: Explore historical air quality data to identify trends and variations over time.

2. **Identify Pollution Hotspots**: Determine geographical areas within Tamil Nadu that consistently experience high pollution levels.

3. **Predict RSPM/PM10 Levels**: Develop a predictive model that estimates RSPM/PM10 levels based on SO2 and NO2 levels.

# Data Sources

- The air quality data used in this project is sourced from [Data Source Name].
- The dataset includes information on various air quality parameters collected from monitoring stations across Tamil Nadu.

# Analysis Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Data will be cleaned and transformed to handle missing values and outliers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial insights will be gained through data visualization and statistical analysis.

3. **Visualization**: Various visualization techniques such as line charts, heatmaps, and geographical plots will be employed to represent air quality trends and pollution levels.

4. **Model Development**: Machine learning models will be built using Python and relevant libraries to predict RSPM/PM10 levels.
